We do not really mean, we do not really mean, (that what we are going to say is true)
HOW AKETEKYIRE, THE CRICKET, GOT HIS TEETH BURNED 
AETEKYIRE, the Cricket, and Ananse, the Spider, started off, saying they were going in search of corn in order to plant it. 
And they got just two grains of corn. And Ananse said, " I am going off to plant mine." 
And the Cricket said, " I am going to roast mine in order to chew it." 
Ananse went and planted his. 
The Cricket, he, too, took his, and put it on the fire. 
It was long in getting cooked, and he sat down there (beside it). 
The Spider, too, he went off to the plantation; he was about to peep under the sheath covering the corn. 
The Corn said, " Don't peep into my eye, lest your finger goes into my eye." 
Ananse was turning his eyes to look at his Dog; 
his Dog said, "You need not look at me, it was not I who did it." 
Ananse was about to break off a stick to beat the Dog, when the stick said, "Don't break me, for (if you do) your Dog will bite me." 
Ananse came home and told the Cricket all about it. 
While he was laughing, he fell into the fire. 
That is how the Cricket got his teeth burned.
This, my story, which I have related, if it be sweet, (or) if it be not sweet, take some elsewhere, and let some come back to me.
