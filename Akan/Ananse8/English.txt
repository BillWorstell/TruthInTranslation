We do not really mean, we do not really mean, (that what we are going to say is true)
KOKOKYINAKA, THE BLUE-CRESTED TURACOU, DID NOT
GO TO ANANSE, THE SPIDER, FOR A LOAN
ONCE upon a time, the Kokokyinaka bird went to Ananse, the Spider, in search of a loan of an asuanu's weight of gold dust (4). Now, as Ananse
himself had none, he went there to his friend, Ntontom, the Mosquito,
to get some and bring it to his friend, the Kokokyinaka bird. The day
passed which the Mosquito had fixed (for the repayment of the loan), and the
Mosquito said to Ananse, " Go and get my gold dust for me." Ananse replied,
"The Kokokyinaka bird is sitting on top of that Silk-cotton-tree, so go and receive
your gold dust." The Mosquito asked, " How shall I go about getting it; the
creature can fly." The Spider replied, " Go and trip up the tree, and when you
see, the tree will break, then you have caught the Kokokyinaka bird, and got back
your gold dust." The Mosquito went and tripped up the tree. When it was about
to break, the Kokokyinaka bird went off from there, pa bu bu bu! Then the
Mosquito came, and he said, " Congratulations, Ananse." That is why we have
a saying which runs, " The Creature called the Kokokyinaka bird did not borrow
from Ananse that the Mosquito should go and trip up the Silk-cotton-tree."
This, my story, which I have related, if it be sweet, (or) if it be not sweet, take
some elsewhere, and let some come back to me.
