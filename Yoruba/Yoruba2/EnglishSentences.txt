The story of a certain woman named Awelli, telling why a bride is brought to her husband by day and not by night.
The woman Awelli was about to marry the King, and all the inhabitants of the country, both men and beasts, adorned themselves and came to the King's house at night on the appointed day. 
But before this day was come, the woman died, and not knowing what to do, the relatives put her in a cloth, placed the long thin chewing stick in her mouth, and carried her towards the house of the King.  
When not far away they began to sing (Chorus), telling the King that Awelli was saluting him, although she could not spit (i.e., expectorate the fragments of the chewed stick), and that she could not eat, although she chewed the stick.
Now it is the custom that when a bride is brought to the bridegroom, something should be given her to eat, but the people bringing Awelli said she could not eat, the adornment was so heavy that she was tired and that she must surely be allowed to rest. 
They asked the King where she should sleep, and laying her there went away.
In the morning the first person that went to see the bride found her dead on her bed; then they all cried, and the King sent a message to Awelli's parents saying, “She is dead.”
And the parents said, “There can be no alternative to our decision now given; we want her back. 
Last night she was in health.”
The King did not know what to do, but certain people went to him and said, “Last night the woman was brought dead.” 
And after this one of the chief men of the town told the King that there was a lack of sense in the country on this subject, and suggested that when anyone was about to be married the bride should be brought by day and not by night.
Arid this is the custom now and has been from that time.
