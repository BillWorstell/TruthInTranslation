The story of a dog and a tortoise.
A dog and a tortoise made friends, and their farms lay adjacent one to the other. 
One day, when they went to their farms, the tortoise bought agidi (corn crushed and sieved and boiled, then wrapped in leaves), and took it to the farm. 
But the dog neglected to buy agidi. 
When at last they stopped work to get food, both were hungry and the tortoise began to eat the agidi, but did not give any to the dog. 
When he had finished he wrapped the leaves up and threw them in the dog's face. 
Then the dog took these leaves and planted them in his farm. 
After some time these leaves grew and bore agidi. 
Now it happened on one day that the tortoise came to the farm, and he had forgotten to buy agidi. 
When they had done working, and the time to eat had come, the dog went to the leaves which he had sown and began to sing, “The agidi of the leaf must fall on me,” and as he sang so it fell and opened. 
Then the dog ate, and the remnant he threw away, giving none to the tortoise.
As they went home the tortoise said, “How is it that you, who are my friend, have no pity, that you eat while you know I hunger?” 
So the dog answered him saying, “Do you not remember the last time when you threw the leaves in my face having eaten the agidi ? 
My agidi is the fruit of the same leaves which I planted after you had done this.”
Then said the tortoise, “Never mind, there is nothing so bad in that,” but he thought, “I can get the agidi for myself.”
One day the tortoise went alone to the farm and when he had finished his work and was hungry, he went to the dog's farm and began to sing at the fruit, desiring that it should fall. 
But no agidi fell, but instead a big stone smashing the tortoise to pieces. 
Then came all the ants and insects and mended him as best they could, but they never managed to get all the marks from his back where the pieces joined together. 
So these marks remain until this day.
