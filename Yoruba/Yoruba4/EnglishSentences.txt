The worship of the thunder-bolt; A story of Shango.
Formerly Shango was a man like other men and his wife's name was Oiya, and Shango was said to be the best doctor living at that time. 
Now a time came when Shango left the world, but before he left it he made a medicine and sprinkled it over the face of the world and pronounced a curse.
And where the medicine fell there grew a herb called yoñri, and the curse so lay that any who ate of yojiri, the medicines that he made should fail of their power and neither work nor cure, and this because Shango had sown yojiri. 
Then he threw a chain up to Heaven and climbed by it to the sky."
When Shango had gone one of the elders took an oath that he would not eat this yoñri leaf, and one day he went to the farm and took the roots of the yoñri first, and then a yam (begbi) and said that he would make a medicine of these two and burn them both together. 
While the two roots burned Shango saw and came down from the sky, and took the medicine from the fire and threw it away. 
When he had gone the man again went into the farm to get more roots, and again he burnt them to prepare the medicine. 
And Shango came down a second time and said, “I told you before, do not burn these roots together,” and for the second time he threw the roots away. 
But the man would not be advised, and for the third time he burnt the roots together and again Shango saw. 
But he said, “I will not go down for a third time; I will put an end to the man's life.” 
Then, taking a certain medicine, he dropped it on the man's head, and the man died.
Then when the people got to the place they found it very, very hot, and when they dug in the place they found a small round stone. 
Then from that day to this they worshipped the thunder-bolt, and the name of the place was Ira.
